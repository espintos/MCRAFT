Monte Carlo RAFT simulations in Julia (started on 12/12/14)

The simulation is now ready for Julia 0.4

There are still some major things to do:

1. Improve the reaction selection block
2. Make the initilization function take the parameter f and set the size of the arrays accordingly
3. Check the plotting routines specially the ones using PyPlot and Gadfly with ribbons.
?. Parallelization (some day)
